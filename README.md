# Project Title:  What Fuels the Seed? Bayesian Insights From Tunisia

**Predicting early-stage venture performance using a hybrid Bayesian modeling approach.**

## üìñ Project Overview
This project examines how **founder and startup characteristics influence early-stage venture performance** within the Tunisian entrepreneurial ecosystem. Using data from **75 startups backed by Flat6Labs Tunisia (2017‚Äì2022)**, it predicts two key outcomes: **revenue growth** and **external investment acquisition**.  

A **hybrid modeling approach** combining regression analysis and Bayesian methods allows robust predictions despite limited data and high variability. Results emphasize the importance of **founder full-time commitment, educational background, technical expertise, and ecosystem support**.  

This study provides a **probabilistic, evidence-based evaluation framework** that helps investors, accelerators, and policymakers make more informed decisions in emerging markets.
