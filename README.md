# Project Title: What Fuels the Seed? Bayesian Insights From Tunisia

**Predicting early-stage venture performance using a hybrid Bayesian modeling approach.**

## üìñ Project Overview
This project examines how **founder and startup characteristics influence early-stage venture performance** within the Tunisian entrepreneurial ecosystem. Using data from **75 startups backed by Flat6Labs Tunisia (2017‚Äì2022)**, it predicts two key outcomes: **revenue growth** and **external investment acquisition**.  

A **hybrid modeling approach** combining regression analysis and Bayesian methods allows robust predictions despite limited data and high variability. Results emphasize the importance of **founder full-time commitment, educational background, technical expertise, and ecosystem support**.  

This study provides a **probabilistic, evidence-based evaluation framework** that helps investors, accelerators, and policymakers make more informed decisions in emerging markets.

![Metrics Overview](Dashboard_Overview/metrics.png)
![Details Overview](Dashboard_Overview/details.png)
![Debug View](Dashboard_Overview/debug.png)

- These visual outputs support data-driven decision-making by presenting both predicted values and associated uncertainty. 
- Indicators such as RMSE, Bayesian R¬≤, AUC, and accuracy provide transparent insight into model performance.  
- The dashboard includes an **expander** to explain the Bayesian modeling approach, including regression types (linear for revenue, logistic for investment) and key predictors with informative priors.  
- The **debugging preprocessors** section exposes feature-wise means and standard deviations calculated during model training to ensure consistent input scaling and correct interpretation of predictions. Target variable statistics and thresholds are also included to revert scaled predictions to their original scale.
